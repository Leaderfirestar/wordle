# Better Wordle Discord Bot

This discord bot exists to allow users within your server play _The New York Time's_ Wordle game. The official integration allows you to see if other players figured out letters in the answer before you play, which is no fun if you know your friends all start with the word "crane." This app exists to hide that information until you have played, as well as allow you to see each other's guesses and previous days answers
